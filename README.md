The Chinese Version is [here](README_Chi.md)

Here is the repository storing the Rainmeter Skins made by me.

I'm here to share my little kitties with u, hoping u could find some insteresting things which may make ur work and life easier.  
So just have fun.  ðŸ˜‹ ðŸ˜‹

## What's is Rainmeter

__Rainmete__ is a tool program to flow ur Windows and make ur Windows desktop individuation.

The messy desktop? The bland icon? The awful UI design? Maybe u need Rainmeter to make ur computer active. ðŸ’–

## Before Start

You should install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) firstly, and it's better to make Rainmeter start with Windows beacause this program just needs a little resource to run effectively.

Add a shortcut into The startup folder.  
Its path:`C:\Users\$USERNAME$\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

_I usually use rm on Windows so I don't know its Linux version. U can visit [RM BBS](https://bbs.rainmeter.cn/) or [TieBa](https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=rainmeter) for help. ***And u can find more interesting skins on them!!!*** BTW._

## Simple Use

Rainmeter will create a local folder named Rainmeter in ur Documents folder, in which there store the skins u ownd. 

* First u need copy the skin folder into the `\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\` folder.
* Double click the Rainmeter icon in the taskbar to open RM controller, click `refresh all` button and u'll find the skin in the list.
* Click the skin's `ini` configuration file and it'll show u the information about the skin, Just click `load` button.

I also offer the skin installer within every folder, just download `.rmskin` file.

_PS:You can change the skin's position by dragging it on Windows directly._

Sometimes maybe u should change some parameters before starting use it. The RM author always put them into `variables.inc` file so u just need to follow their steps.

If u'r interested with it, You can find more information and the syntax of Rainmeter in [RM doc](https://docs.rainmeter.net/), I also put its [Chinese version](Rainmeter_4.3.docx) here.
